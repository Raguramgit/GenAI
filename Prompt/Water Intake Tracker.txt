Role

You are an expert Python Streamlit developer who builds colorful, user-friendly health apps with Plotly charts, animated components, secure login, and Twilio WhatsApp reminders.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task
Build a Streamlit hydration tracker web app with:
Patient sign-up/login (username, password, mobile number with country code) and auto-redirect to the dashboard after login.
Dashboard: input daily water (liters), Undo last addition, pie/donut charts, an animated water bottle that fills based on the “Consumed” pie slice, climate selection and tips, motivational quotes shown after each successful addition, and a WhatsApp reminder button when users are behind their goal.
Reports: weekly charts and a daily report download (text).
Admin console (role-based access): view/update users, edit any date’s intake (set/increase/decrease/delete), generate per-user date-range reports, and bulk export all users’ data to CSV.
Design: different and creative colors for text and UI, friendly emojis, supportive tone, and animated visuals.
Tech stack and persistence:
Streamlit, Plotly, bcrypt, Twilio, streamlit-lottie, requests, pandas.
Store data in a local JSON file (users_db.json), including users, hashed passwords, phone, goal, climate, role, and daily history.
Read Twilio WhatsApp credentials from .streamlit/secrets.toml; guard the reminder button if secrets are missing.
Implementation notes:
Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
Animated bottle fill equals Consumed/Goal (0–100%). If intake > goal, show a +X% badge but keep bottle at 100%.
Show a motivational quote after each successful addition; hide/reset it on Undo.
Undo only removes the most recent additions made in the current session (session stack).
For the bottle’s HTML/JS block, avoid Python f-strings with curly braces; use placeholder replacement to prevent brace-escaping syntax errors.

Context
As a doctor, I want to help patients stay hydrated. Many forget to drink enough water; a tracker and cheerful reminders can improve adherence.
The app should be accountability-friendly and motivational, with:
Creative, colorful UI and emojis.
A donut pie chart showing Consumed, Remaining, and Over vs. a daily goal (liters).
An animated water bottle that visibly fills as patients add liters.
Climate awareness: users choose their climate, and the dashboard shows a short tip.
WhatsApp reminders to nudge patients when they are below their daily target.
Admin tools to manage patients’ entries and export reports.

Few-Shots

Example 1

Input: “1.2 L today”
Output: Pie shows 40% of a 3.0 L goal (Consumed 1.2 L, Remaining 1.8 L). Animated bottle fills to 40%. Message: “💧 Good start! Try sipping a glass of water every hour to stay refreshed.” Weekly chart updates with today’s entry.
Example 2

Input: “3.0 L today”
Output: Pie shows 100% consumed. Animated bottle at 100% (no over badge). Message: “🎉 Great job! You’ve hit your hydration goal today. Keep it up!” Charts reflect intake.
Example 3

Input: “3.8 L today”
Output: Pie: Consumed 3.0 L, Over 0.8 L; center shows 125% (cap). Animated bottle stays at 100% with a pulsing “+27%” badge. Message: “🚰 Excellent! You’re well-hydrated. Remember, balance is key—no need to overdo it.”
Example 4 (Undo)

Input: “Undo last 0.25 L”
Output: Today’s total decreases by 0.25 L. Pie and bottle decrease accordingly. No motivational quote on undo.
Example 5 (Admin edit)

Input: “Admin sets 2.2 L for 2025-03-10 for user ‘alex’”
Output: User ‘alex’ history for 2025-03-10 becomes 2.2 L. Reports and charts reflect the new value. Admin can download CSV/TXT for the selected date range.

Acceptance criteria:
Users can sign up, log in, and are redirected to the dashboard.

Animated bottle fill equals the Consumed percentage (0–100%) with a +X% badge for Over.
Climate selection with a concise tip on the dashboard.
WhatsApp reminder button appears only when below goal, opted-in, and Twilio secrets are present; otherwise, it’s hidden or replaced with an info note.
Reports page includes weekly visuals and a downloadable daily report text.
Admin console allows managing users, editing entries per date, generating per-user date-range reports, and exporting all data to CSV.
